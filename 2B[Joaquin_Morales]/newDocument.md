# Have to and must
 I have to do something= it is necessary to do it, I am obliged to do it:
 - you can´t turn right here. You have to turn left
 - I have to wear glasses for reading.
 - George can´t come out with us this evening. He has to work late.
 - Last week. Tina borke her arm and had to go to hospital.
 - I haven´t had to go the doctor **for ages**.
  
  We yse do/does/did in questions and negativve sentences (for the present and past simple):

  - What do **I** have to  do to get a new drive licence? (for a present and simple past)
  - Karen doesn´t have to work Saturdays. (not karen has´t to)
  - Why did you have to leave early?

You cant use have to with will and might/may:
- If the pain gets worse, you´ll have to got to the doctor.
- I might have to work late tomorrow evening, or I may have to work...

> I might $\rightarrow$ podría

Must is similar to have to :
- It´s later than I thought. I must go, or I have to go.

You can use must to give your opinion (for example, to shay what you think is necessary)
